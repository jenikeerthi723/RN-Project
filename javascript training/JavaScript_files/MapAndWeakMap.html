//let obj = { name: "Karthik" };

// the object can be accessed, obj is the reference to it

// overwrite the reference
//obj = null;
// the object will be removed from memory


//Usually, properties of an object or elements of an array or another data structure are considered reachable and kept in memory while that data structure is in memory.
//For instance, if we put an object into an array, then while the array is alive, the object will be alive as well, even if there are no other references to it.


//let obj = { name: "Karthik" };

//let array = [ obj ];

//obj = null; // overwrite the reference

// the object previously referenced by obj is stored inside the array
// therefore it won't be garbage-collected
// we can get it as array[0]
// Similar to that, if we use an object as the key in a regular Map, then while the Map exists, that object exists as well. It occupies memory and may not be garbage collected.

//let obj = { name: "Karthik" };

//let map = new Map();
//map.set(obj, "...");

//obj = null; // overwrite the reference

// obj is stored inside the map,
// we can get it by using map.keys()

//WeakMap is fundamentally different in this aspect. It doesn’t prevent garbage-collection of key objects.

//The first difference between Map and WeakMap is that keys must be objects, not primitive values:

//let weakMap = new WeakMap();
//
//let obj = { name: "Karthik" };
//
//weakMap.set(obj, "..."); // works fine (object key)

// can't use a string as the key
//weakMap.set("test", "Whoops"); // Error, because "test" is not an object

//Now, if we use an object as the key in it, and there are no other references to that object – it will be removed from memory (and from the map) automatically.

let obj = { obj: "Karthik" };

let weakMap = new WeakMap();
weakMap.set(obj, "...");

obj = null; // overwrite the reference

// obj is removed from memory!
